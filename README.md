# Nutrition App

This project is the final assignment that I did in school. It is a progressive web application (PWA) designed to help users track their nutrition and dietary habits. The application is built using React and Tailwind CSS. In the app it is possible to log food, track nutritional values, and set dietary goals. The app also has a responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across different devices. The app also has offline capabilities as a PWA. The app is also able to scan barcodes to get the nutritional values of the food (This has not been tested in a few years).

The website can only be accessed with a phone [https://pearmihealth.web.app/](https://pearmihealth.web.app/).
